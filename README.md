# Massively Parallel Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository hosts two projects demonstrating the use of massively parallel computing in machine learning, utilizing Spark and Python:

1. **Parallel Logistic Regression Classifier**: Implementation focuses on parallelizing key functions to handle large datasets. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are emphasized.

2. **Parallel K-Means Clustering Algorithm**: Adaptation of K-Means for parallel execution, with an emphasis on efficiency gains in terms of execution time and speedup ratios using the MNIST dataset.

## Contents
- Jupyter notebooks for both serialized and parallelized implementations
- Comprehensive reports and analyses
- Presentation slides
